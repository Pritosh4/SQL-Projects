## Introduction
In this project, we analyze video game critic and user scores as well as sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1977. We search for a golden age of video games by identifying release years that users and critics liked best, and explore the business side of gaming by looking at game sales data.

## Project Tasks
We'll be answering the following questions:
1. What were the ten best-selling video games?
2. How many games are missing review scores?
3. Which were the years that video game critics loved?
4. Was 1982 really that great?
5. Which years dropped off the critics' favorites list?
6. Which were the years video game players loved?
7. Which were the years that both players and critics loved?
8. How were the sales of video games in the best video game years?
